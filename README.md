# Taskify

Taskify is a task management application designed to help you organize and keep track of your tasks efficiently.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

*   **Backend:** Developed using .NET, this API handles business logic, data storage, and user authentication.
*   **Frontend:** A responsive web interface built with React and TypeScript, allowing users to interact with the application.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, you'll need to start both the backend API and the frontend client.

### Backend (.NET API)

1.  Navigate to the `API` directory.
2.  Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.
3.  Run the API using your preferred method (e.g., `dotnet run` or via your IDE).
    The API will typically be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or a similar port configured in `launchSettings.json`).

### Frontend (React Client)

1.  Navigate to the `client` directory.
2.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
4.  Start the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`).
    The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified by Vite).
